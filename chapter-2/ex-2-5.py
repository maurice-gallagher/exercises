# Programming Exercise 2-5
#
# Program to calculate distances traveled over time at a speed.
# This program uses no input.
# It will calculate the distance traveled for 6, 10 and 15 hours at a constant speed,
# then display all the results on the screen.

# Variables to hold the three distances.
# be sure to initialize these as floats.


# Constant for the speed.


# Calculate the distance the car will travel in
# 6, 10, and 15 hours.



# Print the results for all calculations.
speed = float(60.675)

time1 = float(6*speed)
time2 = float(10*speed)
time3 = float(15*speed)

print('you will go', format(time1, ".2f"),' miles in six hours')
print('you will go', format(time2, ".2f"),'miles in ten hours')
print('you will go', format(time3, ".2f"),'miles in fifteen hours')
