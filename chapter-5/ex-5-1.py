# Programming Exercise 5-1
#
# Program to convert kilometers to miles.
# This program accepts a distance in kilometers from the user,
# passes it to a function, which calculates its value in miles
# and displays the result for the user.

# Global constant for the ratio of kilometers to miles

# define the main function
    
    # Define a local float variable to hold the distance in kilometers
    
    # Get distance in kilometers from the user
    
    # pass the distance in kilometers to a function to convert to miles
    
# define the function to convert to miles
# the function takes kilometers as an argument
# calculates the equivalent number of miles
# and prints the result

    # Define a local float variable for miles
    
	# use the global conversion constant to compute miles    
    
    # print the results, formatting float values to 2 decimal places
    
# Call the main function to start the program
